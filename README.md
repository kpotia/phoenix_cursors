# PhoenixCursors
here is the link to the [`blog post`](https://koenvangilst.nl/blog/phoenix-live-cursors) I've watch to build this feature
## About PhoenixCursors
This is a tutorial by [`Koen van Gilst`](https://koenvangilst.nl) which uses fonctionalities of phoenix such as socket, channel and presence to implement the displaying of the moves of the cursor of the user connected to the system. 
## Install
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
